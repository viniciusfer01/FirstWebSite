                <h2>EXOSKELETON</h2> 
                <p>
                    Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability 
                    and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, 
                    every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 
                    30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.

                <p>
                    If there was something better, we’d use it. Help eliminate dents, damage
                    and long-term corrosion with a smooth monochrome exoskeleton that puts 
                    the shell on the outside of the car and provides you and your passengers
                    maximum protection.

                <h2>TESLA ARMOR GLASS</h2> 
                <p>
                    Ultra-strong glass and polymer-layered composite can absorb and 
                    redirect impact force for improved performance and damage tolerance.        
                    PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY
                    Now entering a new class of strength, speed and versatility—only 
                    possible with an all-electric design. The powerful drivetrain and 
                    low center of gravity provides extraordinary traction control and 
                    torque—enabling acceleration from 0-60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds 
                    and up to 500 miles of range.
